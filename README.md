Let the NSA protect the freedom of the users of your IRC server.
Feel like ~~destroying all freedom online~~ fighting terror? I sure do!
Note: this freedom enducing project was inspired by
[plausibility](https://github.com/plausibility)'s
[flask-nsa](https://github.com/plausibility/flask-nsa) for Flask and
[goshakkk](https://github.com/goshakkk)'s
[nsa_panel](https://github.com/goshakkk/nsa_panel) for Ruby on Rails.

##Install##
* `git clone repo && cd repo && npm install`
* Edit `config.json` to add your server and rooms for NSA_BOT to join. Note:
you must have NSA_BOT join a #nsa channel.
* You can edit the duration between helpful reminders in `index.js`.
